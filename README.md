# Miracle Quest - Flutter

This is an Incremental game written in Dart using the Flutter Framework, the spiritual successor to my JavaScript-based incremental game of the same name. The game follows the traditional pillars of an incremental/idle-style game, where you perform simple actions such as clicking on the screen repeatedly to earn currency. After a time, as the game plays itself, including in the player's absence, hence the moniker "idle game".

## Getting Started

Since this game is developed using the flutter framework, that means getting started is simple. Clone/fork/download the code and you can follow the guide here [https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/vs-code] to getting it running on VSCode. Setting up an emulator may take a while, though I intend to release onto the app store in due time.

### Prerequisites

Some basic of Idle/Incremental games would be useful in knowing the typical formulaic pattern of these games - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game. Additionally, knowledge of the flutter framework and dart programming language would be helpful if attempting to fork this project.

## Features

* Two key resources - balance production of Followers and conversion of those Followers into Energy.
* Tiered buildings - Improve the stats of each building as you buy more of them, improving their value proposition.
* Upgrade paths - Upgrade your clicks and each building, to improve your production and progress through the game.
* Statistics - View the breakdown of production per building in the settings menu.
